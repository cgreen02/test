VKTRY takes into account that some sports shoes fit more tightly (cleats, spikes). That's why we also ask for the sport you are playing.

                        "answer": "<p>Different shoe types fit differently. For example, soccer shoes fit much more tightly than basketball shoes. We accommodate for these differences by having different foam cushions: yellow is 7mm thick, black is 5mm and red is 3mm. Because of this, it may be difficult for an athlete who plays multiple sports to move their VKs from a loose fitting shoe to a tighter fitting shoe.<\/p>"
